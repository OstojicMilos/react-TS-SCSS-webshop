# React WebShop with TypeScript and SCSS

A simple webshop app built with React, React Router, React Hook Form, TypeScript and SCSS. This application allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, create orders and manage user authentication. The app is built to work along with nodejs API which is in another repository of mine. This app is a small demo and very much work in progress./
Don't steal my designs (because I haven't put any effort into designs, so it looks horrible) :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

installs all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser (we are not using 3000 because I was running my nodejs API on port 3000). The nodejs API can be found here: [github.com/OstojicMilos/nodejs-mongo-webshop-api](https://github.com/OstojicMilos/nodejs-mongo-webshop-api).

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
